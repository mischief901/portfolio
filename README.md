This will be a portfolio / forum website for future programming projects and 
interesting articles that I come across.

I'm building this site in Elixir and Phoenix for back end and either Electron or
Elm for the front-end. I haven't decided on that yet.

Stay tuned as I build this thing and make suggestions if you want.
